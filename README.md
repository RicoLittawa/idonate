# IDONATE: A WEB-BASED DONATION SYSTEM FOR CDRRMO IN BATANGAS CITY
Donations have a significant impact during a crisis. During the disaster, people who had been ravaged by it had no idea where to begin because their homes had been destroyed. All of their belongings were washed away, and they had no idea how they would survive. In this kind of crisis, charitable organizations, government or non government are involved. People are volunteering to help their fellow citizens that are affected by the disasters. By giving extra clothing, ready-to-eat foods, water, and other basic needs, no matter how tiny or large, is enough for them to get back up and rise again.

City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (CDRRMO) is a government organization for disaster risk reduction in Batangas City led by Mayor Beverly Dimacuha. Their office is located in barangay Bolbok, Batangas City. Their mission is to reduce risk and vulnerabilities, mitigate the negative effects of hazards, and assure Batanguenos' safety and security. They aim to aid everyone who reaches out for help. They are the ones who are first to respond in an emergency. They are also responsible for collecting donations for the people who have been affected by the disasters. The donations they get like clothes, ready to eat food, water, medicine, and other necessities are given to the people in need. It came from the people that are capable of giving extra clothes and other necessities. 

As a result, they encounter a high number of people who want to donate and people who are in need at the same time, especially during calamities. All donations must be monitored to determine where they came from and who the donor is. CDRRMO needs to send acknowledgement receipts to all the donors who contribute to their program as a sign of gratitude. They must collect all of the entries in their preserved data and locate the names and locations of the donors in order to give them credit, which takes some time. 

In line with this, the researchers devised the idea of creating a web system for the organization called "IDonate: A Web-based Donation System for CDRRMO in Batangas City." The advantage of this system is that all the data can be managed in one system. With the use of the internet, this web-based system will lessen the manual process. It will also automate sending the acknowledgement receipt to the donors. Donors may see how their donations are used with the help of a web-based donation system. 

With this, donors will have a far higher level of trust in the organization. Donors are more likely to give online when there is more transparency. It allows the CDRRMO to be more productive and satisfy the needs of a variety of donors and beneficiaries.
